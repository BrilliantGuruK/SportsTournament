This project is the SENG201 assessment, contributing 30% to the final grade. \
Developed in a team of two, we created a sports team management game with a graphical user interface using Java and Swing. \
The game allows players to draft athletes for fencing, buy training equipment, and compete in matches to earn points. \
Key features include team property management, player inventory, and randomly generated matches. \
We emphasized modular design and adhered to object-oriented principles.\
Weekly progress was tracked, and the project included UML diagrams, unit tests using JUnit, and comprehensive documentation with Javadoc.
